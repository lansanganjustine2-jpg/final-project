                    The Kapampangan Food section introduces iconic dishes that have shaped Pampanga’s identity as the Culinary Capital of the Philippines.
                    Each dish carries not only flavor but also a story of tradition, culture, and history.

                    <h3>SISIG</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Sisig</strong> traces its roots back to the 18th century, when it was originally a Kapampangan salad made with green papaya, vinegar, and salt. 
                        Later, during the American occupation in the 20th century, locals began using pig parts discarded from U.S. military bases in Clark, Pampanga. 
                        This resourcefulness transformed sisig into the sizzling pork dish we know today. 
                        Its history reflects Kapampangan creativity and resilience, turning humble ingredients into a world-famous delicacy.

                    <h3>TOCINO</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Tocino</strong> originated from Spanish colonial times when meat preservation techniques such as curing were introduced. 
                        The name comes from the Spanish word <em>tocino</em>, meaning cured pork. 
                        Kapampangans adapted the recipe with their own sweet marinade, making it one of the most popular Filipino breakfast dishes. 
                        Its history shows the fusion of Spanish culinary techniques with Kapampangan flavor preferences.

                    <h3>KARE-KARE</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Kare-Kare</strong> has Spanish and indigenous influences. 
                        Some historians believe it originated from the Moro (Muslim) settlers in Manila who cooked stews with ground peanuts, 
                        while others trace it to the Kapampangans who perfected the dish into a creamy peanut-based stew. 
                        Traditionally served during fiestas and family gatherings, Kare-Kare is deeply tied to Filipino hospitality and Pampanga’s culinary reputation.

                    <h3>BRINGHE</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Bringhe</strong> is Pampanga’s version of paella, introduced during the Spanish colonial period. 
                        While Spanish paella uses saffron, Bringhe uses turmeric and coconut milk, reflecting local adaptation of foreign influences. 
                        It became a celebratory dish, often cooked in large portions for fiestas, weddings, and religious events, symbolizing abundance and unity.

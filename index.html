                    <p>
                        Timplang Kapampangan was created out of a deep love for food, culture, and storytelling. 
                        Our mission is to preserve and share the rich food traditions of Pampanga — a province in the Philippines known for its flavorful and well-loved dishes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For generations, Kapampangans have been known as some of the best cooks in the country. 
                        Their recipes are often passed down through families — not from books, but by teaching in the kitchen. 
                        Influenced by Spanish, Filipino, and Asian flavors, the food of Pampanga tells a long and colorful story. 
                        Timplang Kapampangan is a place where that story continues — through recipes, photos, and memories.

                    <h2>CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE</h2>
                    <p>
                        In Timplang Kapampangan, food is more than just something to eat — it’s a part of who we are.
                        Every dish has meaning. It reminds us of family gatherings, town fiestas, Sunday lunches, or cooking with our grandparents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Food brings people together. It’s how values, love, and tradition are passed from one generation to the next.
                        From slow-cooked stews to detailed rice dishes, Timplang Kapampangan shows the care and pride that go into every meal.

                    <h2>PAMPANGA AS THE CULINARY CAPITAL</h2>
                    <p>
                        Pampanga is called the Culinary Capital of the Philippines and for good reason.
                        It is the birthplace of famous dishes like Sisig, and home to talented chefs like Claude Tayag.
                        Both home cooks and professional chefs look to Timplang Kapampangan for inspiration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pampanga also celebrates its food culture with events like the Sisig Festival,
                        the Giant Lantern Festival with food fairs, and Pista’y Dayat.
                        With a blend of tradition and creativity, Timplang Kapampangan continues to shine in Filipino cooking — both in the past and in the present.
